                <h1>Davis Throughout the Seasons!</h1>
                <p>As a Yolo County local, I've experienced Davis and the surrounding area throughout the many years and seasons. It is something special to me to see the town shift and change over the years I've lived here. I've had many important and amazing memories happen throughout all the seasons in my hometown; especially as a child. From the Halloween crawl downtown as a child, to playing in the park during the fall - Davis is something special to me.</p>

                <h1>Winter</h1>
                <p>This is one of the only times that one can argue that two layers of clothing is necessary in Davis, for the weather is usually warm nine out of the twleve months of the year. Also, as an honorable mention, the snow just two hours away in Lake Tahoe was something many Davis kids grew up going to during the snow season (so I added a picture in acknowledgement!).</p>

                <h1>Spring</h1>
                <p>This is where Davis begins to warm up, the weather is a bit rainy, and the flowers begin to bloom! Here is where everyone can see the beginnings of life after a chilly winter season. Flowers, foliage, and animals begin to reemerge after a long winter's rest.</p>

                <h1>Summer</h1>
                <p>Rancid...Just kidding, even though its nearly one hundred degrees the scenery is quite lovely and the town feels small without the excitement of classes on campus. The town slows down a bit and a few summer activities pop-up for the locals, the stores are quieter, and everything feels small. It is one of my favorite times of year minus the hot weather.</p>

                <h1>Fall</h1>
                <p>While I am a bit biased, this is the best season in Davis. In all of the country really. The leaves turn a lovely shade of red and orange, the days are still warm but begin to cool down, and there are plenty of fun fall activities to enjoy! We have a large vareity of trees in Davis and all of them are changed by the fall weather differently, the leaves dot the fields and the sidewalks - overall, its a wonderful time of year for photography.</p>
