                <p style="margin-top: 5px;">After thinking on my project for a little while, I decided to switch topics from seasons in the Yolo County area to something more personal - my dog! My dog is getting a bit old, she's started to slow down due to her age and I'd like to make a personal little webpage to display some cute photos that really capture the energy of my dog.</p>

                <p>For this to work I'll collect a few images of my dog and items that are central to her life - I'll most likely make these items clickable and when clicked, they'll display a small caption as to what this has to do with my dog. It'll be simple so that the user can understand right away what the objects are and the description will give a bit more insight.</p>

                <p>If you scroll to the next set of enteries, that is where the images I am considering will be placed. I will have some regular JPG photos of my dog but, the items that are clickable will be transparent PNGs.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px;"><img class= "mock" src="images/images.png" width="400" height="400"></p>

                <p>Here are the "clickable" images that I will use on the webpage. These are all specific items that my dog uses or interacts with pretty frequently. When the project is completed, these images will go alongside photos of my dog interacting with these items - for example, a picture of my dog wearing her sweater or playing with her stuffed bunny!</p>
