                <h1>Winter</h1>
                <p>This is one of the only times that one can argue that two layers of clothing is necessary in Davis, for the weather is usually warm nine out of the twleve months of the year.</p>

                <h1>Summer</h1>
                <p>Rancid...Just kidding, even though its nearly one hundred degrees the scenery is quite lovely and the town feels small without the excitement of classes on campus.</p>

                <h1>Fall</h1>
                <p>While I am a bit biased, this is the best season in Davis. In all of the country really. The leaves turn a lovely shade of red and orange, the days are still warm but begin to cool down, and there are plenty of fun fall activities to enjoy!</p>
