                <p>This is the design sketch implemented into the browser. CSS was added to make a "cyber" or "neon" aesthetic to the design rather than the original code. There was an attack button added, creatures were put in the correct places, and animations were tagged onto the creatures of "Cybermon" and "Pastelmon". The design had health bars that drain when the creatures attack each other.</p>

                <p>This is another screenshot of the game in the browser. This is what the attack mode looks like with the creatures added to the game.</p>

                        <p>This creature was also added to the game and a name was given to it. Just like "Cybermon" this creature was created in Procreate on the iPad.</p>
