            <p style="margin-top: 5px;">The theory that "less is more" when it comes to user-based design, is an interesting approach to take. This concept, especially when gathering data, can provide straightforward answers as to what users prefer when interacting with a web based design.Asking more pointed questions and less of them can provide better answers. When doing web design and imputting research into websites or forms, this notion on "less is more" is actually quite helpful - asking too many questions on, lets say a Google form, can overwhelm the users you're asking for imput. However, in instances where asking less questions might not be possible - a financial form, for example - providing a timeline for users is a decent way to minimize the cognitive load on the user. The article provides an example in the form of a "progress bar" that gives the user a visual aid on how long the form will take.</p>

            <p>Another approach is asking the easy questions first and this is a fairly good suggestion. Users are more likely to commit to finishing a question form if they've successfully answered the first few questions. It engages the user, has them interested or at least committed, to answering the entire form. Plus, making clear what is optional and what is required is another decent strategy for creating a hierarchy of importance - meaning, the user will know what to spend the most time on and if they feel committed, they can fill out the optional sections.</p>

            <p>Labels, when used correctly, also provide an easier experience for a user. Having labels disappear after the user enters information into a field, is a poor design choice as the user will have no reference as to what they've filled out. Having labels separate from fields is a better design choice that gives the user clear information that they can look back on as they fill out a form. Also, sizing fields according to what data they might need is an easy way to clean up a page. Overall, providing proper contrast, hierarchy, and accessibilty features to a design will make for a smoother user experience. Having proper, simple designs that the user can provide feedback on, will make for better websites.</p>
