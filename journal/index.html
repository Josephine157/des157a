                <p style="margin-top: 5px;">The theory that "less is more" when it comes to user-based design, is an interesting approach to take. This concept, especially when gathering data, can provide straightforward answers as to what users prefer when interacting with a web based design. Asking more pointed questions and less of them can provide better answers. When doing web design and imputting research into websites or forms, this notion on "less is more" is actually quite helpful - asking too many questions on, lets say a Google form, can overwhelm the users you're asking for imput. However, in instances where asking less questions might not be possible - a financial form, for example - providing a timeline for users is a decent way to minimize the cognitive load on the user. The article provides an example in the form of a "progress bar" that gives the user a visual aid on how long the form will take.</p>

                <p>Another approach is asking the easy questions first and this is a fairly good suggestion. Users are more likely to commit to finishing a question form if they've successfully answered the first few questions. It engages the user, has them interested or at least committed, to answering the entire form. Plus, making clear what is optional and what is required is another decent strategy for creating a hierarchy of importance - meaning, the user will know what to spend the most time on and if they feel committed, they can fill out the optional sections.</p>

                <p>Labels, when used correctly, also provide an easier experience for a user. Having labels disappear after the user enters information into a field, is a poor design choice as the user will have no reference as to what they've filled out. Having labels separate from fields is a better design choice that gives the user clear information that they can look back on as they fill out a form. Also, sizing fields according to what data they might need is an easy way to clean up a page. Overall, providing proper contrast, hierarchy, and accessibilty features to a design will make for a smoother user experience. Having proper, simple designs that the user can provide feedback on, will make for better websites.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 5px;">Once a decent solution to a UI problem, the modal window has become a today's version of a pop-up window that users go out of their way to dismiss. A modal window is an element that sits on top of an application's main window. This means that a user must interact with this modal window before returning to a parent application; something that many consider annoying to ineract with.</p>

                <p>Which begs the question as to why anyone would consider using a modal window in the first place. These lines of code are typically used when someone wishes to grab the user's attention, get input from a user, show additional information in context, or show additional information out of context. This could be a prompt that asks the user to sign in or catch the user's attention for a different task. This could also be a way of providing context through images or larger videos without losing the context of the parent page. However, these modal windows can be overwhelming for a user if used too frequently, giving user's an escape button, close button, or a cancel button can provide a better website experience. Also providing a descriptive title and placing the modal window in an appropriate location, can aid users and make the experience on a website less tedious. When using modal windows in a design, understanding how a user might feel when interacting with them is key - having too many modal windows would make for a poorer user experience if not implemented properly.</p>

                <p>One very important take-away from this article is to not force modal windows upon users. Having a user click on a prompt that opens a modal window, rather than a website pop-up, is a much more fluid way for a user to interact with a website. Pop-ups have become synonymous with annoying ads that bog down a user's experience on a website; making modal windows something a user initiates is a smarter way of going about website design. One example provided in the article is of Twitter when composing a Tweet would prompt a small pop-up window on desktop, clearly displaying what a user was ineracting with and providing those escape hatches should the user not want to send a Tweet. Not taking up too much of the screen and hiding information is key when using a modal window. Best practice is to not use modal windows on mobile devices due to the potential accessibilty issues; using a different coding method, on those particular devices, is a better option.</p>

                <p>Regardless, modal windows, when used properly, can provide a streamlined experience for users on the web. They can also bog down a website if used poorly. Understanding the key principles of modal windows and asking if modal windows are the solution to a particular problem, will make designing websites with them much easier. Modal windows are an interesting aspect of coding on the web and provide a potentially useful too when used correctly.</p>
